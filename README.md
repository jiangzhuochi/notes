# 一个编程菜鸟的笔记本

我正在学习的语言是 Python，Go 和 Rust。这个仓库用来存放我在学习过程中所做的笔记。
由于 Go 和 Rust 刚刚起步，所记甚少，目前以提交 Python 笔记为主，后续会提交其他语言的（咕咕咕）。

另外，本仓库也会记录一些不是编程语言但是和计算机相关的笔记，大多是遇到某个问题的解决方法。

这些笔记比较杂，有的是摘录，也有的是我自己的理解。如果您在浏览笔记时，认为某一条是错误的，或者不够优雅，请您告诉我（如果有人看的话）。

# A programming rookie notebook

The languages I'm learning are python, go and rust. 
This repository is used to store the notes I took during my study.
Because I didn't learn much about go and rust, I mainly submit Python notes at present, and I will submit notes in other languages later.

In addition, the repository will also record some notes that are not programming language but related to computer, most of which are solutions to some problems.

These notes are quite miscellaneous, some are excerpts, some are my own understanding. If you think one of the notes is wrong or not elegant, please let me know.
